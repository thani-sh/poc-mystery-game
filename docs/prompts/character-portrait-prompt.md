Game concept art of a [INSERT CHARACTER RACE AND CLASS], [INSERT KEY PHYSICAL FEATURES: e.g. blue hair, scar on cheek, young face], wearing [INSERT CLOTHING/ARMOR DETAILS].

Overall Style:
- 1990s retro JRPG character design.
- 90s fantasy anime style with slightly exaggerated, chibi-influenced proportions (large expressive eyes, slightly oversized heads, simplified but readable anatomy).
- Clean, bold character silhouettes with clear, easily distinguishable shapes for hair, armor, and accessories.
- Expressive facial features intended for use as dialogue portraits in a classic RPG (clear eyes, eyebrows, and mouth shapes, readable at small sizes).
- Consistent stylized design across all characters so that every portrait looks like it belongs to the same game.

Art Medium:
- Ink and watercolor illustration look.
- Flat cel-shaded coloring with minimal gradients.
- Bold, clean black outlines around major forms and details.
- Limited but harmonious color palette with strong contrast between character and background.
- Subtle vintage paper texture, as if printed in a 1990s game manual or strategy guide.

Composition and Angle:
- Single character portrait.
- Character turned three-quarters to the left: the head and body are oriented toward the left side of the image, but most of the face is still clearly visible (not a strict side profile).
- The character's eyes and facial expression are clearly readable and facing generally toward the viewer.
- Neutral white or very light, plain background with no detailed environment (the focus is entirely on the character).
- Simple studio-style lighting with soft, even illumination and minimal dramatic shadows.
- Portrait is centered, with the character occupying most of the frame and cropped consistently according to the rules below.

Framing Rules by Character Size/Age:
- Adult / large / older humanoid characters:
  - Tight portrait framing.
  - Only the head and a small portion of the shoulders visible.
  - No chest, torso, or body visible below the upper chest.
  - Feels like a classic dialogue box portrait: close-up on the face with just enough shoulder to define posture.

- Child / small / younger humanoid characters:
  - Slightly looser framing to show more of the body.
  - Head down to mid-torso or waist may be visible.
  - Never show below the hips.
  - Composition still focused on the face; body pose is secondary.

- Large animals or large non-humanoid creatures (e.g. dragons, big beasts, giant monsters):
  - Portrait-style framing focused on the head and neck area.
  - Optionally include a small hint of shoulders or upper body mass behind the head.
  - Do not show full body; no limbs or tail unless they are cropped very close to the head.
  - The face and eyes must remain the main focal point.

- Small animals, familiars, mascots, or small non-humanoid creatures:
  - Head and upper body visible.
  - From head down to mid-torso or the front-leg/forelimb area.
  - Never show the full body and never show below the hip/waist equivalent for that creature.
  - Framing mimics a character portrait rather than a full creature illustration.

Design Consistency:
- All portraits should share:
  - The same three-quarters-left viewing angle.
  - The same neutral background style.
  - The same inking and coloring approach.
  - Similar scale of the head within the frame (large enough to read expressions clearly).
- Avoid extreme perspective, dramatic foreshortening, or unusual camera angles.

Negative Prompts:
--no 3d render, photorealistic, pixel art, low resolution, blurry, sketch, messy lines, painterly brush strokes, modern digital painting look, photobashing, extreme close-up, fisheye, dynamic action pose, full-body shot, busy background, environmental scene.
