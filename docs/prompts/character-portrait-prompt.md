Character portrait sprite sheet of a [INSERT CHARACTER DESCRIPTION], a human character set in the 1980s UK. [INSERT KEY PHYSICAL FEATURES: e.g. freckles, short hair, young face], wearing [INSERT CLOTHING DETAILS: e.g. school uniform, casual everyday clothes, adventure-ready outfit].

Portrait Sprite Sheet Layout:
- 3:4 aspect ratio (width:height) with a 4x3 grid (12 cells total, equally divided into 4 columns and 3 rows).
- Each cell contains a character portrait with a different expression, emotion, or state.
- All portraits in the sheet should be the same character, maintaining consistent design across all frames.
- Transparent background (alpha channel) for the entire sprite sheet to allow easy extraction and background customization.
- Grid lines should be clear and visible to delineate each cell boundary.

Portrait Layout (in order, left to right, top to bottom):
Row 1 (Talking and Neutral):
  - Cell 1: Talking frame 1 (mouth open, mid-speech, neutral/friendly expression)
  - Cell 2: Talking frame 2 (mouth in different position, alternate talking pose for animation)
  - Cell 3: Neutral/Idle (default expression, calm, eyes forward)
  - Cell 4: Thinking/Pondering (hand on chin, thoughtful expression, eyes slightly upward or to the side)

Row 2 (Positive Emotions):
  - Cell 5: Happy/Smiling (bright smile, cheerful eyes, upbeat expression)
  - Cell 6: Laughing (wide smile or laugh, eyes closed or squinting with joy)
  - Cell 7: Surprised (eyes wide, mouth open in shock or amazement, raised eyebrows)
  - Cell 8: Determined/Confident (firm expression, focused eyes, slight smirk or serious look)

Row 3 (Negative Emotions and States):
  - Cell 9: Angry/Upset (furrowed brow, frown or scowl, intense eyes)
  - Cell 10: Sad/Worried (downturned mouth, concerned eyes, possibly tears or drooping features)
  - Cell 11: Exhausted (tired eyes, half-closed or drooping, weary expression, slight slouch)
  - Cell 12: Dizzy/Confused (swirly or unfocused eyes, dazed expression, slightly tilted head)

Overall Style:
- 1990s retro JRPG character design.
- 90s fantasy anime style with slightly exaggerated, chibi-influenced proportions (large expressive eyes, slightly oversized heads, simplified but readable anatomy).
- Clean, bold character silhouettes with clear, easily distinguishable shapes for hair, armor, and accessories.
- Expressive facial features intended for use as dialogue portraits in a classic RPG (clear eyes, eyebrows, and mouth shapes, readable at small sizes).
- Consistent stylized design across all portraits so that every portrait looks like it belongs to the same game.

Art Medium:
- Ink and watercolor illustration look.
- Flat cel-shaded coloring with minimal gradients.
- Bold, clean black outlines around major forms and details.
- Limited but harmonious color palette with strong contrast between character and transparent background.
- Subtle vintage paper texture, as if printed in a 1990s game manual or strategy guide.

Portrait Framing and Composition:
- Character turned three-quarters to the left: the head and body are oriented toward the left side of the image, but most of the face is still clearly visible (not a strict side profile).
- The character's eyes and facial expression are clearly readable and facing generally toward the viewer.
- Portrait is centered within each cell, with the character occupying most of the frame.
- Simple studio-style lighting with soft, even illumination and minimal dramatic shadows.

Framing Rules by Character Age:
- Adult characters:
  - Tight portrait framing.
  - Only the head and a small portion of the shoulders visible.
  - No chest, torso, or body visible below the upper chest.
  - Feels like a classic dialogue box portrait: close-up on the face with just enough shoulder to define posture.

- Child / younger characters:
  - Slightly looser framing to show more of the body.
  - Head down to mid-torso or waist may be visible.
  - Never show below the hips.
  - Composition still focused on the face; body pose is secondary.

- Large animals (e.g. horses):
  - Portrait-style framing focused on the head and neck area.
  - Optionally include a small hint of shoulders or upper body mass behind the head.
  - Do not show full body; no limbs or tail unless they are cropped very close to the head.
  - The face and eyes must remain the main focal point.

- Small animals (e.g. dogs, cats):
  - Head and upper body visible.
  - From head down to mid-torso or the front-leg/forelimb area.
  - Never show the full body and never show below the hip/waist equivalent for that creature.
  - Framing mimics a character portrait rather than a full creature illustration.

Expression and Emotion Guidelines:
- Each portrait should clearly convey its intended emotion or state through facial features.
- Maintain consistent character design (hair, face shape, clothing, colors) across all 12 cells.
- Only facial expressions, eye positions, and mouth shapes should change between cells.
- Body posture can shift slightly (e.g., slouch for exhausted, tilt for dizzy, hand on chin for thinking) but should remain subtle.
- Eyes are the key to emotion: use eye shape, pupil size, and eyelid position to convey feelings.
- Mouth shapes should be varied and expressive: open for talking/surprise, curved for happy/angry, etc.

Design Consistency:
- All 12 portraits must share:
  - The same character design (hair, face, clothing, proportions).
  - The same three-quarters-left viewing angle.
  - The same art style and line weight.
  - The same color palette.
  - The same level of detail.
  - The same scale and size within their cells.
- Lighting should be consistent across all frames - simple, even illumination from above and slightly in front.
- Avoid dramatic shadows or perspective changes between frames.

Grid and Background:
- The overall image should have a 3:4 aspect ratio (width:height).
- Divide the image into a precise 4x3 grid with 12 equal cells (4 columns, 3 rows).
- Transparent background (alpha channel) for all cells - no solid background color.
- Thin, visible grid lines between cells to clearly separate each portrait (optional but helpful).
- No environmental elements, props, or scene details - focus entirely on the character portrait.

Technical Requirements:
- 3:4 aspect ratio (width:height) - e.g., 1536x2048, 768x1024, or similar dimensions maintaining this ratio.
- PNG format with alpha channel transparency support.
- Each cell is exactly 1/4 of the total width and 1/3 of the total height.
- High enough resolution that individual portraits remain crisp when extracted from the sheet.
- Portraits should be easy to extract programmatically by dividing the image into 4 equal columns and 3 equal rows.

Negative Prompts:
--no 3d render, photorealistic, pixel art, low resolution, blurry, sketch, messy lines, painterly brush strokes, modern digital painting look, photobashing, extreme close-up, fisheye, dynamic action pose, full-body shot, busy background, environmental scene, inconsistent character design between portraits, different scales between portraits, solid background, opaque background.
