# ADR-002: Project Architecture and Structure

Date: 2025-12-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The PixiJS Creation Template provides a base structure, but we need to define how we'll organize code for a mystery investigation game with specific requirements:
- Grid-based exploration
- NPC interaction and dialogue
- Clue collection and tracking
- Multiple game screens (title, menu, investigation, exploration)
- Save/load system
- Dialogue system
- Evidence and clue management

## Decision

We will extend the Creation Template's architecture with a layered structure optimized for mystery game development:

### Directory Structure

└── main.ts             # Application entry point
```
### Architecture Layers

1. **Engine Layer** (`src/engine/`)
   - Handles low-level PixiJS integration
   - Manages application lifecycle
   - Provides navigation, audio, and resize services
   - Template-provided, minimal customization needed

2. **App Layer** (`src/app/`)
   - Screens and UI components
   - Visual presentation logic
   - User interaction handling
   - Bridges game logic with rendering

3. **Game Layer** (`src/game/`) [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Pure game logic (clue management, investigation mechanics)
   - Should be largely render-agnostic
   - Contains game state and systems
   - Can be unit tested independently

### Key Patterns

**Screen Lifecycle:**
- Each screen extends `Container`
- Implements lifecycle methods: `prepare()`, `show()`, `hide()`, `resize()`, `update()`
- Can pause/resume when popups are shown
- Declares required asset bundles

**Asset Management:**
- Uses AssetPack for optimization
- Raw assets in `raw-assets/`
- Processed assets output to `public/assets/`
- Assets loaded by bundle (preload, main, etc.)
- Manifest auto-generated by AssetPack

**State Management:**
- No global state framework initially (keep it simple)
- Screens own their state
- Shared state in service classes (e.g., `GameState`)
- Will evaluate Redux/MobX if complexity grows

**Data-Driven Design:**
- Game entities are data objects (Characters, Clues, Maps)
- Systems process entities (investigation system, dialogue system)
- View components render entities (sprite representation)
- Separation between logic and rendering

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns (engine, app, game)
- Screens are self-contained and easy to test
- Game logic can be unit tested without rendering
- Easy to add new screens and popups
- Asset pipeline is optimized out of the box
- Hot reload works well with screen-based architecture
- Data-driven approach makes content creation easier

### Negative
- Additional layer of abstraction beyond template
- Need to build game systems from scratch
- Communication between layers requires careful design
- May need refactoring as game complexity grows

### Neutral
- Will need to define game data schema
- State management approach may evolve
- Asset organization needs discipline
