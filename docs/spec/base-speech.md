# Base Character Portrait Instructions

## Overall Style

- 1990s retro JRPG character design
- 90s fantasy anime style with slightly exaggerated, chibi-influenced proportions (large expressive eyes, slightly oversized heads, simplified but readable anatomy)
- Clean, bold character silhouettes with clear, easily distinguishable shapes for hair, armor, and accessories
- Expressive facial features intended for use as dialogue portraits in a classic RPG (clear eyes, eyebrows, and mouth shapes, readable at small sizes)
- Consistent stylized design so that every portrait looks like it belongs to the same game

## Art Medium

- Ink and watercolor illustration look
- Flat cel-shaded coloring with minimal gradients
- Bold, clean black outlines around major forms and details
- Limited but harmonious color palette with strong contrast between character and white background
- Subtle vintage paper texture, as if printed in a 1990s game manual or strategy guide

## Portrait Framing and Composition

- Character turned three-quarters to the left: the head and body are oriented toward the left side of the image, but most of the face is still clearly visible (not a strict side profile)
- The character's eyes and facial expression are clearly readable and facing generally toward the viewer
- Portrait is centered within the frame, with the character occupying most of the space
- Simple studio-style lighting with soft, even illumination and minimal dramatic shadows

## Framing Rules by Character Age

### Adult characters

- Tight portrait framing
- Only the head and a small portion of the shoulders visible
- No chest, torso, or body visible below the upper chest
- Feels like a classic dialogue box portrait: close-up on the face with just enough shoulder to define posture

### Child / younger characters

- Slightly looser framing to show more of the body
- Head down to mid-torso or waist may be visible
- Never show below the hips
- Composition still focused on the face; body pose is secondary

### Large animals (e.g. horses)

- Portrait-style framing focused on the head and neck area
- Optionally include a small hint of shoulders or upper body mass behind the head
- Do not show full body; no limbs or tail unless they are cropped very close to the head
- The face and eyes must remain the main focal point

### Small animals (e.g. dogs, cats)

- Head and upper body visible
- From head down to mid-torso or the front-leg/forelimb area
- Never show the full body and never show below the hip/waist equivalent for that creature
- Framing mimics a character portrait rather than a full creature illustration

## Expression and Emotion Guidelines

- Each portrait should clearly convey its intended emotion or state through facial features
- Maintain consistent character design (hair, face shape, clothing, colors) across all portraits
- Only facial expressions, eye positions, and mouth shapes should change between different expressions
- Body posture can shift slightly (e.g., slouch for exhausted, tilt for dizzy, hand on chin for thinking) but should remain subtle
- Eyes are the key to emotion: use eye shape, pupil size, and eyelid position to convey feelings
- Mouth shapes should be varied and expressive: open for talking/surprise, curved for happy/angry, etc.

## Design Consistency

All portraits of the same character must share:

- The same character design (hair, face, clothing, proportions)
- The same three-quarters-left viewing angle
- The same art style and line weight
- The same color palette
- The same level of detail
- The same scale and size
- Lighting should be consistent - simple, even illumination from above and slightly in front
- Avoid dramatic shadows or perspective changes between frames

## Background

- Pure white background (#ffffff) for the entire portrait
- No environmental elements, props, or scene details - focus entirely on the character portrait

## Technical Requirements

- PNG format
- High enough resolution that portraits remain crisp (recommended: 512x512 or higher for a single portrait)
- Square aspect ratio for individual portraits

## Negative Prompts

--no 3d render, photorealistic, pixel art, low resolution, blurry, sketch, messy lines, painterly brush strokes, modern digital painting look, photobashing, extreme close-up, fisheye, dynamic action pose, full-body shot, busy background, environmental scene, transparent background, multiple characters, grid layout
