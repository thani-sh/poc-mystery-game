# Idle Down - Front Facing

## Description

4-frame idle animation cycle - standing facing viewer.

## Animation Sequence Details

Create a subtle 4-frame breathing/idle cycle in the 2x2 grid:

1. **Frame 1 (Top-Left):** Base standing pose, relaxed.
2. **Frame 2 (Top-Right):** Slight inhale/rise (shoulders/chest move up 1 pixel).
3. **Frame 3 (Bottom-Left):** Hold peak of inhale or slight variation (maybe eyes blink).
4. **Frame 4 (Bottom-Right):** Exhale/return to base (shoulders/chest move down).

**STABILITY NOTE:** In each of the 4 frames, the character's body (head/torso) must be centered in the exact same position within the square. Do not shift the character horizontally or vertically between frames (except for the specific breathing motion). This prevents "shaking" when animated.

## Pose Details

- Character facing directly toward viewer
- Standing position, feet shoulder-width apart
- Arms at sides, relaxed
- Very subtle movement to show life, not exaggerated

## Viewing Angle

- Front view - character faces camera directly

## Usage

Default idle pose when character is standing still and facing downward/forward.
