# Base Character Portrait Instructions

## Overall Style

- 1990s retro JRPG character design
- 90s fantasy anime style with slightly exaggerated, chibi-influenced proportions (large expressive eyes, slightly oversized heads, simplified but readable anatomy)
- Clean, bold character silhouettes with clear, easily distinguishable shapes for hair, armor, and accessories

## Art Medium

- Ink and watercolor illustration look
- Flat cel-shaded coloring with minimal gradients
- Bold, clean black outlines around major forms and details
- Limited but harmonious color palette with strong contrast between character and transparent background
- Subtle vintage paper texture, as if printed in a 1990s game manual or strategy guide

## Design Consistency

All images of the same character must share:

- The same character design (hair, face, clothing, proportions)
- The same three-quarters-left viewing angle
- The same art style and line weight
- The same color palette
- The same level of detail
- The same scale and size
- Lighting should be consistent - simple, even illumination from above and slightly in front
- Avoid dramatic shadows or perspective changes between frames

## Background

- Transparent background (alpha channel) for the entire image to allow easy extraction and background customization
- No environmental elements, props, or scene details - focus entirely on the character

## Technical Requirements

- PNG format with alpha channel transparency support
- High enough resolution that image remain crisp (recommended: 512x512 or higher)
- Square aspect ratio

## Negative Prompts

--no 3d render, photorealistic, pixel art, low resolution, blurry, sketch, messy lines, painterly brush strokes, modern digital painting look, photobashing, extreme close-up, fisheye, dynamic action pose, busy background, environmental scene, solid background, opaque background, multiple characters, grid layout
