# Spritesheet Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all character spritesheet generation.

## Composition

- Pure white background (#ffffff) for the entire image.
- No environmental elements, props, or scene details - only the character.
- Use 1:1 aspect ratio for the image dimensions and use the full canvas.
- Position the character sprite at the bottom center of the image.
- Simple, readable sprites with clear silhouettes optimized for 16-bit era aesthetics
- Clean, bold character shapes with easily distinguishable features (hair, clothing, accessories)
- Expressive poses and movement that read clearly even at small sprite sizes
- Consistent stylized design so that every sprite looks like it belongs to the same character and game
- Limited but harmonious color palette with strong contrast between character and white background

## Spritesheet Consistency (CRITICAL)

**When an idle spritesheet reference is provided, treat the generation as an EDIT operation, not creating from scratch:**

- The idle spritesheet serves as the DEFINITIVE reference for the character's appearance, proportions, style, and color palette
- Preserve EXACT character design from the idle spritesheet: same face shape, eye style, hair design, clothing details, body proportions, and color values
- Match the exact art style, line weight, shading approach, and level of detail from the idle reference
- Only animate the character's pose and movement - DO NOT alter any visual characteristics
- The character in every animation must look identical to the idle version, just in different poses
- Think of this as keyframing: the idle spritesheet shows what the character looks like, and you're just adding motion
- Maintain consistent sprite dimensions and positioning across all animations so they can be swapped seamlessly in-game

**Without an idle reference, establish a new baseline that will be used for future animations**

## Format Rules

**CRITICAL: Generate a 4x4 grid spritesheet with 4 animations, one per row**

- Create a square image divided into a 4x4 grid (16 equal squares)
- Each spritesheet contains one animation of the character.
- Each row is dedicated to each cordial direction (down, left, right, up) in that order from top to bottom. !!!IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE ROWS!!!
- All 4 frames should show subtle variations in the pose to create smooth animation when cycled
- Animation frames start from the left to right in each row.
- Each square contains one animation frame of the character.
- within each square should have the character on the same y axis position so that the character does not appear to jump up and down between frames.
- Frames must be evenly spaced in the 4x4 grid with clear separation

## Negative Prompts

--no inconsistent character design, equipment, clothing, foreshortening, motion blur, single frame, multiple characters in one frame, varying character sizes, varying positions within frames, grid layout with more or fewer than 16 frames
