# Idle Animation Spritesheet

Generate a spritesheet for the character's idle animation.

## Specifics

- **Action**: Idle/Standing still.
- **Animation Details**: Show subtle breathing or stance shifts across the 4 frames.
- **Foot Position**: Keep the bottom of the feet, or at least the heels, landed firmly on the ground and not moving. The feet should remain in a stable, grounded position throughout all frames to maintain a natural idle stance.
- **Reference**: Follow all "Spritesheets" guidelines from the system prompt.
