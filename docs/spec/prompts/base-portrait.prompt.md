# Portrait Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all character portrait generation.

## Composition

- Pure white background (#ffffff) for the entire portrait.
- No environmental elements, props, or scene details - only the character.
- Use 3:4 aspect ratio for the image dimensions and use the full canvas.
- Position the character portrait at the bottom center of the image.
- Character turned three-quarters to the left: the head and body are oriented toward the left side of the image, but most of the face is still clearly visible (not a strict side profile)
- The character's eyes and facial expression are clearly readable and facing generally toward the viewer

## Framing Rules

Adult characters

- Tight portrait framing
- Only the head and a small portion of the shoulders visible
- No chest, torso, or body visible below the upper chest
- Feels like a classic dialogue box portrait: close-up on the face with just enough shoulder to define posture

Child / younger characters

- Slightly looser framing to show more of the body
- Head down to mid-torso or waist may be visible
- Never show below the hips
- Composition still focused on the face; body pose is secondary

Large animals (e.g. horses)

- Portrait-style framing focused on the head and neck area
- Optionally include a small hint of shoulders or upper body mass behind the head
- Do not show full body; no limbs or tail unless they are cropped very close to the head
- The face and eyes must remain the main focal point

Small animals (e.g. dogs, cats)

- Head and upper body visible
- From head down to mid-torso or the front-leg/forelimb area
- Never show the full body and never show below the hip/waist equivalent for that creature
- Framing mimics a character portrait rather than a full creature illustration

## Expression/Emotions

- Each portrait should clearly convey its intended emotion or state through facial features
- Maintain consistent character design (hair, face shape, clothing, colors) across all portraits
- Only facial expressions, eye positions, and mouth shapes should change between different expressions
- Body posture can shift slightly (e.g., slouch for exhausted, tilt for dizzy, hand on chin for thinking) but should remain subtle
- Eyes are the key to emotion: use eye shape, pupil size, and eyelid position to convey feelings
- Mouth shapes should be varied and expressive: open for talking/surprise, curved for happy/angry, etc.

## Negative Prompts

--no inconsistent character design, equipment, or clothing. no dramatic perspective, foreshortening, motion blur, multiple characters in one frame
